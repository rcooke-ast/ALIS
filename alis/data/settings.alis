# RUNNING ALIS
run  atomic       atomic.xml    # The name of the table that contains the relevant atomic transitions
run  bintype      km/s			# Set the type of pixels to use -- If pixels have constant velocity use "km/s", if pixels have constant Angstroms use "A".
run  blind        True			# Run a blind analysis -- In order to print out the best-fitting model, this must be set to False.
run  convcriteria 0.2           # Convergence criteria in units of the parameter error

# ITERATE
iterate model None              # Make dynamic changes to the model using a user-specified function ('None' means do not iterate). Two arguments (separated by a comma - no spaces) are allowed, but not necessary. The first argument is the name of the module, the second is any text string that you want passed to the module.
iterate data None               # Make dynamic changes to the data (doesn't do anything yet... probably best to just rerun alis...)
