\section{Example \dmod\ files and fitting}

The detail for how to prepare a \dmod\ file
is described in Section~\ref{sec:description}.
In this Section, a few standard examples will
be introduced, and fitted with \alis. These
examples (both the data and the \dmod\ files)
are provided in the `examples' directory.

\subsection{Your first fit -- The example from Section~\ref{sec:description}}



\subsection{A metal-poor DLA}


\subsection{Fine-structure constant variation}


\subsection{Isotope ratios}


\subsection{Quasar spectrum}
