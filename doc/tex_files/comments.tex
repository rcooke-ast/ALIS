\section{Comments/Questions/Additions?}
\label{sec:comments}

I would love to hear any comments you have of how
to improve \alis, and/or features that you would want
or feel limited by. If you find a bug (there probably is one!)
then let me know and I'll do my best to find a quick solution.
If you have a snippet of code that will fix the bug, then please
send it to me!

Did you write a useful function? Please send it to me and I'll
include it in the next version of \alis.

My current contact details are:
