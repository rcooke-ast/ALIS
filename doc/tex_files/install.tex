\section{Installing and Updating \alis}

\alis\ is written in the \python\ software environment,
it can be used (at least in principle) either as it comes
(recommended), on the python command line, or can be
imported into your own \python\ code. Check it out from
Github:

Use the master branch only (this is where I will place the most up-to-date version of \alis).

\subsection{Software Requirements}
I tried to use as few ``additional'' packages as possible
when writing \alis, but you really can't beat the following
\python\ essentials (in fact, they are probably already
installed on your system, and if not, they should be!).
If you want to use \alis, you will need to download and
install the following packages:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textsc{python} (required, version $3$)
\item \textsc{numpy} (required)
\item \textsc{matplotlib} (required)
\item \textsc{astropy} (required)
\item \textsc{cuda} (optional --- only needed if you want to use GPU multiprocessing)
\item \textsc{pycuda} (optional --- only needed if you want to use GPU multiprocessing)
\end{itemize}

Follow the installation instructions on the GitHub page:

\subsection{Updating \alis}

It is also very easy to update \alis. I recommend that you
do this every so often, as I have a chance to fix bugs and
add new features. \textbf{NOTE: If you make any changes
to the code yourself, you run the risk of overwriting your
changes or breaking the code if you update}. Or if you are
a git user, you can merge conflicts yourself! By all means
update the code yourself, but if you find a bug and know
how to fix it, please let me know so that I can help to
implement the required change for all users.
To update the code, change directory to where you have
installed \alis\ and issue the following on a command line:

\vspace{0.4cm}
\begin{myenv}
git pull\\
python setup.py install\\
\end{myenv}
\vspace{0.3cm}

You should now have a working, updated version of the code.
