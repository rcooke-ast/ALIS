To run this example execute the following commands in a terminal window

cd model
alis generate_spectra.mod
alis fit_spectra.mod

The second command was used to generate fake data. This fake data was then used as input in the third command and an absorption line profile was fit to the data. If you have your own data you would like to fit, the second step is unnecessary (of course).
