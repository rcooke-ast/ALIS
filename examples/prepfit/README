This example will help you to prepare more complicated fits with ALIS.
In particular, this example opens a GUI that allows you to manually
select the fitting regions and save "snips" of the data that can be
used as input to ALIS (the idea is that this should make your ALIS
fits a bit quicker to set up, and a bit quicker to run).
